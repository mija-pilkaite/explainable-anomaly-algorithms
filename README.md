# Algorithm Design for Explainable Anomaly Detection for Data Streams

### Overview
The project focused on [ExStream](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Yanlei.Diao/publications/xstream-edbt2017.pdf) algorithm, where it is used to explain anomalies detected in data. I aimed to adapt the algorithm to real-life data simulated on Apache Spark applications to provide sensible explanations for anomalies within high-dimensional time series data. I successfully improved the algorithm to provide explanations as features that are the most anomalous and made the algorithm globally stable for the same type of anomalies (explanations are similar/the same for the same type of anomalies). 

As of today, the code is not open-source, thus so far only my thesis itself is available. Hopefully, that will change in the future:)
